  <h2>Argentinian Empanadas</h2>
  <p>Argentine empanadas are often served during parties and festivals as a starter or main course. Shops specialize in
    freshly made empanadas, with many flavors and fillings. <br>

    Every region of Argentina has its own characteristic variant. <br>

    Those of Salta are small, juicy and spicy, and contain potatoes, peppers and ground chili. The Jujuy variant adds
    peas
    and garlic. Its filling is called "recado" and the repulgue (the way of closing the empanada) "simbado". The La
    Rioja
    variant includes hard-boiled egg, red bell pepper, olives, and raisins. In Jujuy, there are two variants: "creoles"
    and
    "arabs". Those of Santiago are considered especially juicy. Those of Catamarca are similar but smaller. Tucumán
    is
    known
    for the empanada Creole; an annual "National Empanada" festival is held in Famaillá. Those of Famaillá are made with
    matambre and fried in good fat, competing with the "entreveradas" (mixed-grated), in which the matambre is mixed
    with
    chicken breast, garlic, ground chili, hard-boiled egg and cumin. Those of Mendoza are large and include olives and
    garlic. Those of San Juan have a higher proportion of onion, which made them juicier and slightly sweet, olives are
    also
    common and sometimes fat is also added to the "recado" or the dough. In San Luis they are big, seasoned with oregano
    and
    hot pepper, and kneaded with pork fat. In Córdoba, they were called "federal cake" or "empanadas de Misia
    Manuelita",
    famous because pears boiled in wine with cloves were added to their filling. Today they are not so sweet but it is
    tradition to sprinkle them with sugar. In Traslasierra they add carrots and potatoes. In the Litoral, where
    immigrants
    from various parts of the world predominated, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Corrientes fill them with river fish, being
    delicious the surubí, dorado or with white sauce and Goya cheese. In the Cordillera of Patagonia, they are made with
    lamb and on the coast with seafood. In Buenos Aires, the Creole empanada is so important that it has been declared a
    Cultural Heritage of Food and Gastronomy by the Argentine Ministry of Culture</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <h4>For the filling:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>500 grams of minced beef</li>
    <li>1/2 kilogram chopped onion</li>
    <li>2 chopped green onions</li>
    <li>1 minced garlic clove</li>
    <li>2 hard boiled eggs chopped</li>
    <li>oil amount needed</li>
    <li>dried ground chili as needed</li>
    <li>cumin powder as needed</li>
    <li>paprika powder as needed</li>
    <li>pies for empanadas</li>
    <li>1 egg to paint</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For the dough:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter , room temperature</li>
    <li>1 egg , beaten</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons oil</li>
    <li>¾ - 1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>Egg wash ( 1 egg mixed with 1 Tbsp water)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <h4>For the filling:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil over medium-low heat. Add onion and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often.</li>
    <li>Add garlic and diced red pepper. Cook for another 10 minutes, stirring often. Add chili powder, cumin, sweet
      paprika,
      and oregano. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Increase heat to medium and add the ground beef. Season with salt and pepper and cook, crumbling into small
      pieces,
      until browned. Stir in beef boullion.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and transfer mixture to a bowl to cool for 10 minutes. Then, stir in green onion, olives,
      parsley, and
      hard-boiled eggs.</li>
    <li>Cover and chill mixture for at least 1 hour or up to 3 days (depending on freshness of ingredients). It’s
      important that
      the mixture is chilled before filling the empanadas.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>For the empanada dough:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Add flour and salt to a large bowl and stir to combine. Add egg and butter and stir well to combine. Add oil and
      warm
      water and stir until the mixture starts to come together into a dough ball. Add more water if it’s too dry.</li>
    <li>Place dough in clean greased bowl and cover tightly. Allow to rest at room temperature for 1 hour. (Or,
      refrigerate for
      up to 1 day, removing from the fridge 20 minutes before using.)</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Assembly:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Divide the dough into two pieces. On a greased countertop roll each piece into a very large circle, about 1/8in
      thick
      (not so thin that it might break when filling or baking).</li>
    <li>Use a small bowl or round cookie cutters to cut the dough into circles about 6in in diameter for regular size
      empanadas
      or 3 inch for mini empanadas (empanaditas).</li>
    <li>Remove the excess dough from around the cut circles and keep the circles where they are for filling them (so
      they hold
      their perfect circle shape). Leftover scraps can be re-rolled to make more dough to cut out.</li>
    <li>Place about 2 tablespoons of filling (for regular size empanadas) in the center of each circle, leaving plenty
      of space
      around the border. Moisten the edges of the circle with water, then fold the dough over and match the ends
      together to
      form a semi-circle.</li>
    <li>Pinch the edges together and then seal the ends by crimping them with a fork or pinching and twisting/folding it
      over.</li>
    <li><strong>Baked Empanadas:</strong> Place empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush with a
      little bit of egg wash and
      bake at 375° For 25-30 minutes until golden brown and fully cooked.</li>
    <li><strong>Fried Empanadas:</strong> it is best to refrigerate the empanadas for 20 minutes before frying to help
      the dough firm up and hold its shape before
      placing in the hot oil. Add several inches of hot oil to a pot and heat to about 365° F. Fry one or two empanadas
      at a
      time, flipping once, until golden on both sides (1-2 minutes per side). Place on a paper-towel lined plate.</li>
