  <h2>Argentinian Milanesas</h2>
  <p>Similar to the Austrian wiener schnitzel, the Italian cotoletta alla Milanese, and the Japanese tonkatsu, the
    Argentinian milanesa is also a breaded cutlet shallow-fried in oil. The cutlet typically comes either from the round
    or
    from the eye of the round, which are lean cuts, meaning they have less fat, marbling, and sinew when compared to
    most
    other cuts of beef. Besides beef, milanesa can also be prepared with veal, pork, or be made vegetarian by using soy
    cutlets or eggplant instead. The first step when preparing milanesa is to prepare the meat, which means removing any
    fat
    or sinew to get as clean of cutlets as possible, which are then pounded with a mallet until a half a centimeter
    thick.
    The cutlets are then first dipped typically in a mixture of beaten eggs, chopped garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper,
    but,
    depending on the recipe, this mixture can also include mustard. Once soaked in the egg mixture, the cutlets are
    dredged
    in breadcrumbs and then shallow-fried in a pan until golden. The milanesa should be served warm, with just a drizzle
    of
    lemon juice and a side of mashed potatoes or fries. In Argentina, they also have variations on the basic milanesa,
    such
    as caballo, which is milanesa topped with an egg and milanesa a la napolitana, which has a topping of tomato salsa,
    ham,
    and mozzarella cheese.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Beef</li>
    <li>Breadcrum</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Parsley</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Sunflower oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Method</li>
    <p>Typically, the beef cutlets are dipped in a mixture of eggs and flavorings such as garlic, parsley, salt, pepper,
      mustard, chili, and oregano, before they are dredged in breadcrumbs. Occasionally, the egg mixture can be diluted
      with
      water or milk, depending on the recipe. In some cases, the meat is also marinated beforehand in a mix of salt,
      parsley,
      garlic, and vinegar, which has the role to flavor and tenderize the meat before it's pounded with a mallet until a
      half
      a centimeter thick. Often, milanesa recipes will call for a three-part breading process, where the first step is
      dipping
      the cutlets in flour. For a crispier milanesa, it is recommended to double coat the cutlets in breadcrumbs.</p>
    <li>Meat</li>
    <p>The meat of choice is lean meat, with as less sinew and fat as possible, such as round roast (pecato) and eye of
      the
      round (nalga), although top sirloin can also be used. If you're not a red meat lover, chicken, soy, and even
      vegetables
      like eggplant can be used instead. The meat should be, ideally, a half a centimeter thick â€” this is achieved by
      pounding
      the cutlets with a mallet which also helps tenderize the meat and helps the breadcrumbs to stick to the meat
      easier.</p>
    <li>Variations</li>
    <p>The milanesa has many variations; the most known are the ham, tomato salsa, and mozzarella cheese topped milanesa
      a la
      napolitana and caballo where a fried egg is placed on top of the cutlet. Milanesa can also be stuffed, usually
      with
      cheese and ham.</p>
